0,"100 Days Into Trump's Second Term: What's Changed With Tariffs, Immigration and More","President Trump was sworn in for a second term in January intent on transforming America and its place in the world.
In Mr. Trump’s view, the world is divided into two kinds of countries: those that “have the cards” and those that don’t.
Tellingly, on his first trip abroad in his new term, for Pope Francis’ funeral, Mr. Trump held one detailed conversation, with Mr. Zelensky.
“Come here often?” Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump were about two weeks into a presidential partnership that had turned into a bureaucratic bull rush.
Mr. Trump has for the most part been fine having Mr. Musk around, and clearly Mr. Musk likes being there.","changed, days, american, china, second, musk, federal, trumps, united, whats, trump, 100, tariffs, states, mr, immigration, president, term",2025-04-28,0.0524458913000579,0.3626733287931202,1,Positive
1,"After the Arrests and Bullets, Trump Takes on Second Term With a New Fervor","But where Roosevelt used his early weeks to build a new edifice, Mr. Trump has used his to tear it down.
In effect, he is trying to repeal the liberal social compact and international system that Roosevelt constructed, “unwinding neoliberalism,” as one aide put it.
Now the scar tissue is deep, the guardrails are gone and the sense of righteous mandate is palpable.
The trials and tribulations of the past few years, including the 2024 assassination attempt in Butler, Pa., took time to process, Mr. Jeffress added.
“But I think he came to the conclusion — the right conclusion — that God has a purpose for him.”","fervor, days, trials, used, presidential, mr, jeffress, takes, arrests, roosevelt, path, trump, second, bullets, president, term",2025-04-30,0.1615937702144598,0.428173359207842,2,Positive
2,"In Alabama Commencement Speech, Trump Mixes In the Political","He urged the audience of college students not to think they were too young to accomplish great things, before waxing on about tariffs.
“Don’t try to be someone else,” he implored them, after attacking due process for unauthorized immigrants.
And he told them not to think of themselves as victims, before diverting into how the 2020 election was “rigged” against him.
On Thursday night, President Trump addressed the 2025 graduates of the University of Alabama, vacillating between campaign rally material and a commencement speech as he used his past political grievances to encourage students to fight for their futures.
Our heroes are the ones who take charge of their own destiny, make their own luck and determine their own fate, despite the odds.”","commencement, mixes, think, encourage, used, speech, victims, told, students, young, worldin, trump, political, alabama, america",2025-05-02,0.1763157894736842,0.4662280701754386,3,Positive
3,Trump Posts an Image of Himself as Pope,"President Trump on Tuesday had a ready answer when reporters asked who he would like to see become the next supreme pontiff.
The origins of the photo were not immediately clear, and Mr. Trump did not include any commentary in his post.
He shared the image on Truth Social, Instagram and X, and the White House reposted it on its official Instagram and X accounts.
The idea of “Pope Trump,” as some people called it, was immediately polarizing.
Several commenters on Truth Social, which is run by a company controlled by Mr. Trump, called the post sacrilegious and said it fueled misinformation.","posts, pope, reporters, image, white, social, x, instagram, trump, post, mr, truth",2025-05-03,0.0285714285714285,0.1845238095238095,4,Neutral
4,Trump Says He Wants Alcatraz Restored as a Prison,"President Trump said on Sunday that he wanted federal law enforcement agencies to work on restoring Alcatraz, now a museum, to a functioning maximum-security prison.
Repeating one of his constant refrains that the United States had become a dangerous, lawless place, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that he wanted Alcatraz, an island in San Francisco Bay, to be enlarged and rebuilt “to house America’s most ruthless and violent offenders.
We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our country illegally.”It was not immediately clear how his musing could be put into action, given that any such project would be extraordinarily expensive and that the administration already planned to cut billions of dollars from the Justice Department budget.
Mr. Trump said he had instructed the Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department and the Homeland Security Department to work on his idea, along with the F.B.I.
— a curious choice given that the bureau plays no role in incarcerating people convicted of crimes.","department, wrote, justice, criminals, work, given, bureau, alcatraz, wants, trump, wanted, restored, prison",2025-05-04,-0.258974358974359,0.6064102564102565,5,Negative

11,Nikole Hannah-Jones: Trump Is Erasing Black History – Mother Jones,"President Donald Trump’s second term has swung a wrecking ball at diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and programs throughout the country.
Few writers seem better suited to explain this unique moment in America than Nikole Hannah-Jones.
A New York Times journalist and Howard University professor, Hannah-Jones has spent years studying and shaping compelling—and at times controversial—narratives about American history.
“We haven’t seen the federal government weaponized against civil rights in this way” since the turn of the century, Hannah-Jones says.

10,"Trump Is Eager to Defund Harvard, Yet Publicly Subsidized Hate Groups Get a Pass","According to a 2024 report from Media Matters, Martin has called himself a “big admirer” of the nonprofit group.
Media Matters wrote:Martin also repeatedly hosted VDare leader and white nationalist Peter Brimelow on his now-defunct radio program The Ed Martin Movement.
In 2018, too, the Trump administration reinstated the tax-exempt status of white nationalist Richard Spencer‘s National Policy Institute, which had its status revoked automatically for failing to file mandatory 990 tax returns for three years running.
It is telling that a president who never questioned the tax-exempt status of white nationalist groups is now suggesting his IRS might take a hard look at Harvard’s.

9,North Carolina GOP Judge Finally Concedes After Six-Month Effort to Steal Election Fails – Mother Jones,"On Monday, however, federal district court Judge Richard Myers, who was appointed by Donald Trump, overruled the state courts in North Carolina and ordered the state board of election to certify Riggs’ election.
Riggs’ victory maintains the 5–2 Republican majority on the state Supreme Court.
“We’ve knocked over the first domino that we need to for Democrats to take back the North Carolina Supreme Court in 2028,” Riggs told me after the election.
Even though Griffin was ultimately unsuccessful, his six-month effort to overturn the election did a tremendous amount of damage to the democratic process.
That will go a long way toward making election subversion the norm rather than the exception, especially in states, like North Carolina, where Republicans control the top courts and election boards.","supreme, votes, state, judge, court, carolina, griffin, sixmonth, jones, overturn, north, gop, mother, riggs, finally, fails, election, steal",2025-05-07,0.1447698135198135,0.5687572843822843,10,Positive

(Spokespeople for DOL, the Women’s Bureau, and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.)
Last year, the Women’s Bureau awarded $6 million in WANTO funding to nine organizations, the department’s largest-ever award; the year before that, it awarded $5 million to seven groups.
Spencer, who runs the formerly Women’s Bureau–funded construction program in North Carolina, expects DOGE’s latest cuts to come back to haunt the Trump administration.

6,Trump Administration to Announce Trade Deal With Britain,"President Trump is expected to announce on Thursday that the United States will strike a “comprehensive” trade agreement with Britain.
Hours after teasing that an agreement would soon be announced, Mr. Trump said in a social media post that a deal had been reached that would “cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.”“Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement,” he wrote.
“Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!”Mr. Trump is expected to announce the deal from the Oval Office later Thursday.
The president had not specified which nation would be part of the deal in his post late Wednesday night.

Casi todas las publicaciones de la cuenta, que data de 2011, compartían artículos, declaraciones y comentarios de otros dirigentes eclesiásticos, no del propio cardenal.
En julio de 2015, la cuenta compartió un artículo del cardenal Timothy M. Dolan, de Nueva York, que calificaba de “problemática” la “retórica antiinmigrante” de Trump.
Tres años después, la cuenta compartió una publicación del cardenal Blase Cupich, de Chicago, en la que decía que no había “nada remotamente cristiano, estadounidense o moralmente defendible” en la política del gobierno de separar a los niños migrantes de sus padres.

21,FEMA Will No Longer Go Door-to-Door to Assist Disaster Victims,"“Door-to-door canvassing is another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” Geoff Harbaugh, FEMA’s associate administrator for the Office of External Affairs tells WIRED in an email.
“Going door-to-door, especially in critically hit areas, to share information is very important,” he says.
There is no mention in the FEMA memo of the investigation or recent controversy and no reasoning provided for ending the door-to-door canvassing process.
FEMA has deployed door-to-door canvassing in states with federal disaster declarations approved under the Trump administration: An agency press release from March mentions teams going door-to-door in West Virginia following February’s severe storms.
“FEMA does not act alone.”DeVoe says that like many of the responsibilities being shifted from FEMA to local response, the task of surveying survivors door-to-door will now fall to local and state responders.","longer, victims, going, assist, disaster, fema, canvassing, survivors, states, agency, doortodoor, memo, federal",2025-05-08,0.0950909090909091,0.3637554112554113,22,Positive

With Martin, Trump tried to force GOP senators to confirm an unqualified bumbler and extremist just because he is Trump’s “favorite US Attorney.” That didn’t work.
That makes Martin’s derailed nomination a defeat for Trump too.
The rejection of Martin’s nomiation is also a sign of the limits of Trump’s effort to rewrite the history of January 6 and the lies that led to it.

Like Mr. Kennedy, Dr. Means has repeatedly said that America is in the midst of a chronic disease crisis.
Also like Mr. Kennedy, she has suggested that environmental toxins and the food system are to blame.
The surgeon general has no real authority to set policy; the power of the job is in the platform and in the surgeon general’s reports.

18,Laura Loomer Targets Trump’s Pick for Surgeon General as Kennedy Pushes Back,"President Trump’s selection of Dr. Casey Means, a Stanford-educated wellness specialist and book author, as his next surgeon general provoked a vigorous debate on Thursday over whether someone who is not a practicing physician should serve as the nation’s top doctor.
Laura Loomer, the far-right activist who holds so much sway with Mr. Trump that more than a half-dozen national security officials were fired on her advice, emerged as a vocal critic.
So did Nicole Shanahan, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s former running mate, who called the choice “very strange.”Dr. Means, a close ally of Mr. Kennedy’s, trained as a surgeon in otolaryngology — ear, nose and throat medicine — but left her surgical residency after four years to practice “functional medicine,” which focuses on the root causes of disease.
She has said she was disillusioned with the medical establishment, and had concluded it was failing patients.
Ms. Loomer ridiculed Dr. Means on social media Thursday, calling her a “total crack pot” who “USES SHROOMS AS ‘PLANT MEDICINE’ AND TALKS TO TREES!” and “DOESN’T EVEN HAVE AN ACTIVE MEDICAL LICENSE.” As evidence, Ms. Loomer posted excerpts of Dr. Means’s weekly newsletter, in which Dr. Means muses on recipes, product recommendations and other topics, including “mindset shifts and habits.”","wellness, medicine, weekly, vocal, laura, kennedy, targets, trumps, dr, medical, pushes, pick, general, surgeon, mr, loomer, means",2025-05-08,0.0685714285714285,0.2633333333333333,19,Positive
14,The Brain Rot Cabinet – Mother Jones,"Last week, baffling many and delighting a few, HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared during a Trump administration Cabinet meeting that he’s engaged in a hunt for what he said were 300,000 missing children trafficked by the Biden administration.
“During the Biden administration, HHS became a collaborator in child trafficking for sex and for slavery, and we have ended that.
The way that the claim about 300,000 missing children made it out of Kennedy’s mouth helps to demonstrate how conspiracy theories function in the current, fever-dream version of the GOP.
But by in October 2024, JD Vance claimed during a debate with Governor Tim Walz that 300,000 children were missing.

José Miguel Cruz, an expert in transnational gangs who has interviewed more than 2,000 members of Central American gangs, including members of MS-13, said nothing about Mr. Abrego Garcia’s tattoos signals MS-13 membership.
Mr. Cruz has seen MS-13 members with many versions of elaborate tattoos: full-face ones of MS-13 and also ones like 666 or a beast that represents Satan.

“Her academic achievements, together with her life’s work, are absolutely outstanding,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.
Means’ medical opining has occasionally veered in a New Age direction.
Some of those people greeted Means’ nomination with outrage and dark suspicion, with many claiming Dr. Kelly Victory, a health influencer and ivermectin fan, was Kennedy’s preferred choice.

Some political strategists and advocates on the left pointed to these posts as evidence that the pope shared their politics.
Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer called him “anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis” in a post on X.

17,Trump Declares Biden’s Digital Equity Act ‘Racist’ and ‘Unconstitutional’,"President Trump on Thursday attacked a law signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. aimed at expanding high-speed internet access, calling the effort “racist” and “totally unconstitutional” and threatening to end it “immediately.”Mr. Trump’s statement was one of the starkest examples yet of his slash-and-burn approach to dismantling the legacy of his immediate predecessor in this term in office.
The Digital Equity Act, a little-known effort to improve high-speed internet access in communities with poor access, was tucked into the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that Mr. Biden signed into law early in his presidency.
The act was written to help many different groups, including veterans, older people and disabled and rural communities.
But Mr. Trump, using the incendiary language that has been a trademark of his political career, denounced the law on Thursday for also seeking to improve internet access for ethnic and racial minorities, raging in a social media post that it amounted to providing “woke handouts based on race.”In reality, the law barely mentions race at all, only stating that racial minorities could be covered by the program while including a nondiscrimination clause that says that individuals could not be excluded from the program “on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability” — language taken from the Civil Rights Act of 1964.","unconstitutional, race, declares, law, signed, access, digital, racist, bidens, act, racial, trump, internet, program, equity, president",2025-05-08,0.0499999999999999,0.3722222222222222,18,Neutral

Many of those goods ended up in some of the export-oriented countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.
In recent years, as China’s domestic economy has been hobbled by a housing market crash, the government has leaned more heavily on the shipment of its goods overseas.","china, economy, goods, chinas, yeung, data, exports, scrambling, shock, factories, war, market, countries, southeast, trade",2025-05-09,0.0776679841897233,0.2328063241106719,32,Positive

The project, a wind farm called Empire Wind, is being built by the Norwegian energy giant Equinor in the waters off Long Island, N.Y.
But those plans were thrown into disarray last month when the Trump administration, which is skeptical about offshore wind power, ordered an indefinite halt to construction.
The pause shocked Carsten Pedersen, who owns Welcon with his brother Jens, and the wind industry.
Welcon was tapped as a subcontractor to supply the towers for the project by Vestas Wind Systems, a leading wind turbine maker, which has its headquarters in Aarhus in Jutland.","workwelcon, pedersen, turbine, giant, project, called, industry, trumps, wind, jutland, policies, faces, welcon, europes, towers, uncertainty",2025-05-09,-0.1555555555555555,0.5074074074074074,34,Negative

28,"Trump administration mulling end to habeas corpus, legal right to challenge one’s detention","The Trump administration is considering suspending the writ of habeas corpus, the legal right to challenge one’s detention, Stephen Miller, a top White House adviser, said on Friday.
“The constitution is clear, and that of course is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus could be suspended in time of invasion.
A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not,” Miller said to a group of reporters at the White House.
Miller, long known for his far-right positions on immigration, has sought to deploy a maximalist approach in carrying out mass deportations.
Many of the immigrants that the Trump administration has moved aggressively to deport – including Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk – have filed habeas petitions challenging efforts to deport them.","public, legal, detention, mulling, law, writ, trump, habeas, end, efforts, suspended, deport, corpus, invasion, challenge, right, ones",2025-05-09,0.101532738095238,0.3933035714285714,29,Positive

Cofa agreements have previously been inked with independent countries, and Greenland would probably need to separate from Denmark for such a plan to proceed.
The interior department, which plays a key role in administering Cofa agreements through its office of insular affairs, also did not respond.
Washington’s existing Cofa agreements with Palau, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia are seen across the US political spectrum as important for countering China’s growing influence in the Asia Pacific region.
Republican lawmakers have at times opposed elements of the budget allotted to fund Cofa agreements, creating deep frustrations in the countries that rely on the funds.","officials, considers, special, trump, agreements, status, island, national, push, plan, official, cofa, greenland, amid, involved, control, sources",2025-05-09,0.0876102292768959,0.4235229276895943,28,Positive

23,Lawyer who prosecuted Trump hauled in front of House judiciary committee,"The former special counsel prosecutor Jay Bratt is scheduled to appear before the Republican-led House judiciary committee next week as it attempts to find instances of politicization in the federal criminal cases brought against Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter.
Bratt’s appearance is the first known instance of a special counsel prosecutor being hauled before the judiciary committee since Trump took office vowing revenge and personally directing the firings of more than a dozen prosecutors who worked for Smith within days of his inauguration.
A spokesperson for the judiciary committee did not immediately respond to questions about the deposition.
But the judiciary committee, led by Republican chair Jim Jordan, has long believed that the special counsel cases were the result of political animus against Trump at the justice department.
The House judiciary committee has also taken a special interest in a fraught and disputed meeting between then-Trump legal team attorney Stanley Woodward and Bratt at justice department headquarters during the height of the classified documents case in November 2022.","classified, documents, trump, special, lawyer, bratt, committee, house, justice, prosecuted, judiciary, hauled, counsel",2025-05-09,0.0545882936507936,0.3141865079365079,24,Positive
29,US-UK trade deal imposes conditions on ownership of British steel plants,"The US deal on steel tariffs imposes conditions on the “nature of ownership” of British plants as part of its efforts to freeze out Chinese steel, it has emerged.
It is understood Donald Trump’s administration pushed for requirements to be attached to the steel deal to ensure that the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe was not used by Beijing as a backdoor to circumvent US tariffs.
However, before the UK government took steps to seize control of British Steel last month the US had been concerned that the Scunthorpe plant could have been used as a base for processing Chinese steel to take advantage of lower tariffs.
It is set to bring car tariffs down to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if conditions are met.
Trump, who has now turned his attention to the first trade talks between the US and China in Geneva on Saturday, said the “final details [of the UK deal] are being written up in the coming weeks”.","imposes, requirements, steel, uk, plants, usuk, deal, trade, conditions, ownership, british, terms, tariffs, chinese, sources",2025-05-09,0.1265652557319224,0.3930114638447971,30,Positive

Trump said on Friday that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods “seems right”, suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145% levies imposed on Chinese imports.
Tariffs imposed on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145%, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245%.
Bessent has said the meetings in Switzerland would focus on “de-escalation” and not a “big trade deal”.
The head of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said on Friday that she welcomed the talks, calling them a “positive and constructive step toward de-escalation”.","officials, meet, bessent, geneva, deescalation, privacy, goods, trade, outside, newsletter, duties, talks, chinese",2025-05-10,0.0616807610993657,0.2913117889862076,46,Positive

43,‘From all sides’: universities in red states face attacks from DC and at home,"The faculty senate at Indiana University, Bloomington, voted in favor of a defence compact last month, days before Republican legislators passed a sweeping overhaul of the state school’s governance.
This week, faculty at the University of Miami in Ohio and at the University of Arizona – both states with Republican-majority legislatures – also passed resolutions in favor of mutual alliances among universities.
The resolutions are nonbinding, as faculty senates play an advisory role at most universities, and so far no administrations have responded to the call.
“All universities in all states are under threat,” said Jim Sherman, a retired psychology professor at Indiana University, Bloomington, who proposed the resolution passed by faculty there.

39,Judge orders White House to temporarily halt sweeping government layoffs,"Donald Trump’s administration must temporarily halt its sweeping government overhaul because Congress did not authorize it to carry out large-scale staffing cuts and the restructuring of agencies, a federal judge in California said on Friday.
“As history demonstrates, the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,” Illston said.
Trump directed government agencies in February to work with Doge to identify targets for mass layoffs as part of the administration’s restructuring plans.
It also alleged the office of management and budget, Doge and the office of personnel management exceeded their authority and violated administrative law.
Illston said plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm without the temporary restraining order, which she said preserves the status quo.","white, authority, temporarily, trump, judge, orders, federal, office, layoffs, house, management, work, sweeping, illston, doge, plaintiffs, agencies, halt",2025-05-10,0.0041666666666666,0.4686594202898551,40,Neutral

But she has been opining on Fox for 14 years, mostly recently as a host on The Five, the network’s popular afternoon talkshow.
